### To run the application:

# please use a later npm version (node v10+)

# install all the dependencies
npm install

# runs the server that serves the json for the task
npm run server

# runs the application
npm run start

# follow the link in the console (http://localhost:1234)

Funcitonality and assumptions:
I know that the task forbid from using extra libraries and I hope that the 
http and json servers would not be considered as such. They are used to facilitate
making an asynchronous request and to improve the general experince not to simplify the
task or help achieve it.



Feedback:
It was a fairly simple task and it took a few hours. There is difinitelly place
for a lot of improvement but I already spent a lot of time other task and time is short.
Hope you like the solution!
